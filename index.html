	<h2>To an Old Lady</h2>
	<h3>William Empson</h3>
	<p>Ripeness is all; her in her cooling planet<br>
	Revere; do not presume to think her wasted.<br>
	Project her no projectile, plan nor man it;<br>
	Gods cool in turn, by the sun long outlasted.<br><br>

	Our earth alone given no name of god<br>
	Gives, too, no hold for such a leap to aid her;<br>
	Landing, you break some palace and seem odd;<br>
	Bees sting their need, the keeper's queen invader.<br><br>

	No, to your telescope; spy out the land;<br>
	Watch while her ritual is still to see,<br>
	Still stand her temples emptying in the sand<br>
	Whose waves o'erthrew their crumbled tracery;<br><br>

	Still stand uncalled-on her soul's appanage;<br>
	Much social detail whose successor fades,<br>
	Wit used to run a house and to play Bridge,<br>
	And tragic fervour, to dismiss her maids.<br><br>

	Fears her precession do not throw from gear.<br>
	She reads a compass certain of her pole;<br>
	Confident, finds no confines on her sphere,<br>
	Whose failing crops are in her sole control.<br><br>

	Stars how much further from me fill my night.<br>
	Strange that she too should be inaccessible,<br>
	Who shares my sun. He curtains her from sight,<br>
	And but in darkness is she visible.</p><br>
